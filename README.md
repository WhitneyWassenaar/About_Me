# About me
Hello World!


This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.


## Who is this person?
Hi, my name is Whitney. I'm from the Netherlands and I just started learning how to code. This is a new world to me—hopefully one filled with great chances to make the best of life.

I'm actually a creative person. I like to draw and paint, both traditionally and digitally. What I really love to do is make art of horses. I think horses are the most beautiful creatures on earth. They move elegantly, they catch my eye, they can be great friends for life, and they always live in honesty.
  
### Career and personal development
I was a truck driver for 4 years. In those years I learned a lot about myself and how to deal with different circumstances. When I wanted to get my truck driving license, most people who knew I was going for it thought I couldn't do it because I was a young, small, creative girl (I was 22). With my experience in my previous work field, I found out that (heavy) physical work is not meant for me. Also, monotonous work bores me. I’ll never go against my biorhythm again (starting before 6:00); that is even more harmful to mind and body than the physical work.

I have learned what to accept and not to accept from other people or employers. I have grown from a super shy and anxious person into a more self-confident person. I'm still not where I'm supposed to be, or where I want to be. But I have learned that change comes from taking risks or getting out of your “not-so-comfortable” zone. And I know my worth.

### So why do I want to learn programming?
I think it is a great skill to have. If you are good, you can get paid well.

My highest diploma is HAVO (NL) / senior general secondary school (EN). It is possible for me to get a bachelor’s degree if I finish one. I could get a challenging job, working inside an office, with normal start times. I would finish on time and still have an evening to spend with my dog and my partner. That’s what I want for my career: having a nice job, paid well, and plenty of time to relax or learn something else. I think I would not feel like I’m working too hard for what I get paid for. It would not cost me my health as much as the job I had before. It would also cost me less time and energy for the same amount of money I used to make in my previous job. I think.

Programming is something I can start right now. I have access straight away from my desk. There are a lot of free courses online, and it would give me a few steps ahead before I start an education in programming.

Because I have to work, I have to follow a part-time study. Most of the other bachelor’s programs (not computer-science-related) are full-time, and then I wouldn’t even know if I really like the program. Programming bootcamps sound safe: they don’t consume all of my time, I learn a new skill, and if I want, I can continue a part-time bachelor’s study while I’m working. It could be a win-win situation.

Another reason for me to learn programming is that I can use the knowledge for personal projects. I can create my own projects and hopefully make a game or an app in the future. Also, I am someone who always asks: “Why?” And when a piece of code works, I get excited. That’s why I think programming suits me. The big question is: Will I succeed in learning this skill?

### Interests
 First of all, my biggest interest is creating art. You can think of drawing, painting, and sculpting, both traditionally and digitally. Most of the time, animals are the main subjects I like to make art of.

I also like to play games (horse games, fantasy MMORPGs, browser/text-based games). I've always wondered how someone could make that kind of game. I also imagined my own versions of several games I played. I knew I would need programming skills and other programs for creating the user interface and art. But I just thought I couldn’t do that. I did not believe I could be a developer too. One thing that is simple but true: if you really want it, you can do it. If you believe in yourself, you can do it. Everyone had to start somewhere.

I also have an interest in building websites, but I don't know much about it yet. I know a little bit of HTML and CSS. I want to learn how to build websites that are safe for users—for example: webshops, portfolios, or company websites. I don't know much about servers yet.

3D modelling is also a skill I would like to grow in. I like to create character concept art and bring it to life through 3D modelling.
